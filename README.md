The Student Attendance Management System (SAMS) is a centralized system designed to record,
manage, and monitor student attendance across all faculties and departments within the university.
The system will provide the following key features:
• Generation of unique QR codes for each course session
• Secure attendance capture using QR code scanning
• Verification of student presence using geolocation
• Identity confirmation through facial recognition
• Real-time recording and storage of attendance data
• Role-based access for students, lecturers, class coordinators, and administrators
• Attendance reports for individual students, courses, lecturers, and faculties
The system aims to improve attendance accuracy, reduce manual paperwork, and support academic
monitoring and decision-making.
